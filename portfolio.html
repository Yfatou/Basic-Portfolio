            <!--Paragraph about me-->
            <p>Born and raised in Senegal-West Africa-, I moved to France to go to college at 18years old. My husband, my daughters and I moved to the US 4 years ago.</p>
            <p>After my degree in Computer Science adapted to management, I started my career as a developper in Banking Industry. I enjoyed working directly with my customers-accounting services, back and middle office agents- and putting my skillsets into practice.
            I spent three years coding and started moving into more testing and client support which led me to Project management.</p>
            <p>If I'm not in front of a computer - which was the case the last 4 years - you will most likely find me in my kitchen cookink for my family or baking all the French pastries I miss.
            Depending on the weather, I also enjoy going for a walk and/or a run with my family - to burn all those calories.</p>
